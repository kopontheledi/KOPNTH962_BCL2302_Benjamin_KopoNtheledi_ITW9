# digital-resume (bcl2302_Benjamin_KopoNtheledi_ITW9)

I used CSS and HTML to create my digital resume.I designed it for all devices (small, medium and large).

I am creating my digital profile for when I am looking for employment I can show my future employers what I can do. My resume consists of links to my contact details to make it easier for my futre employers to reach me.
